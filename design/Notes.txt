Status: failing to load page after wanted validation fails because failed record is incomplete
  next step: create test for 0 validations,
    create safeguards for missing content when page loads

TO DO: rename columns to remove duplication of table name


When the verbs page is visited
I want to display verb tables
So I can see the full vocabulary

When a user inputs a verb
I want conjugations to be autofilled
So they can add words quickly

When a displayed word is ambiguous
I want to show notes on hover
So it can be disambiguated

- Input words on website with javascript autofill. both English and
  - Ajax validation for preexisting words

- Abstract factories for checking equality - what?

- modify delete words

- check refresh problem for new words
